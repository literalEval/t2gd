# t2gd
A torrent downloader for GDrive, using Google Colab. Saves your bandwidth, gives high speed and helps you bypass firewall :)

### Usage

Open the `t2gd.ipynb` file in here and click on `Open in Colab` on the top left.

OR

Copy the ipynb script to your Google Drive and then run the script from there
by double clicking. Other things are written in the script itself.
If the file isn't recognized by GDrive, right click on it and choose 'Open With' or a similar option and install 'Google Collab' from there.
Then GDrive will start recognizing `.ipynb` files and you'll be able to open it.
